**Better Uptime** helps you keep your services reliable and your users informed. When something goes down, you want to know first — and you want your users to see a clear status page instead of guessing.

## Why uptime matters

Downtime costs more than lost traffic. It erodes trust, triggers support load, and can break SLAs. Monitoring your endpoints and APIs gives you a clear picture of availability so you can fix issues before users report them.

With Better Uptime you get:

- **Uptime monitoring** — HTTP, HTTPS, TCP, and more, with configurable check intervals and alerting.
- **Status pages** — Public pages that show current status and incident history so users stay informed.
- **Incident management** — Track incidents, post updates, and manage communication in one place.
- **Alerts and on-call** — Notifications via email, SMS, Slack, and other integrations, plus on-call scheduling.

## Who it's for

Better Uptime is for product teams, DevOps, and anyone running services that need to stay up. Whether you run a single API or many microservices, you get a simple way to monitor, alert, and communicate status.
