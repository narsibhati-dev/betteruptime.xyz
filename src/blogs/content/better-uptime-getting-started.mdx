This guide walks you through the basics of getting started with Better Uptime: signing up, adding your first monitor, and creating a status page.

## Sign up

Create an account at Better Uptime. Once you're in, you'll see your dashboard where you can add monitors and configure alerts.

## Add your first monitor

A monitor checks a URL or endpoint at a set interval (e.g. every minute). If the check fails — for example, the server returns an error or times out — Better Uptime can notify you right away.

1. Create a new monitor and choose the type (HTTP/HTTPS, TCP, etc.).
2. Enter the URL or host you want to check.
3. Set the check interval and any advanced options (timeout, expected status code, etc.).
4. Configure alert contacts (email, Slack, SMS, etc.) so the right people get notified.

After you save, Better Uptime will start checking. You can see uptime history and incident history in the dashboard.

## Create a status page

A status page is a public page that shows your users whether your services are operational. When you create an incident or post an update, it appears there so users don’t have to guess.

1. Create a new status page and give it a name and subdomain.
2. Add the services or monitors you want to show (e.g. "API", "Dashboard", "Login").
3. Customize the page (branding, layout) if needed.
4. Share the status page URL with your users.

From then on, when you report or resolve an incident, the status page updates automatically so your users stay in the loop.
